# Operator Lifecycle Manager

[Operator Lifecycle
Manager](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager) is a
management framework for extending Kubernetes with operators.  Administrators
are able to deploy optional components that are managed by an operator into the
cluster.

In this tutorial, we will deploy a few operators to the cluster.

# Kubernetes Marketplace

The marketplace provides a catalog of operators provided by Red Hat and others.

To explore the marketplace via the web console, open the following url in a
browser:

```sh
oc get routes -n openshift-console console -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"/marketplace"}{"\n"}'
https://console-openshift-console.apps.example.com/marketplace
```

## Package Manifests

Operators are packaged into a set of manifests.

To view the package manifests, do the following:

```sh
oc -n openshift-marketplace get packagemanifests
NAME                    AGE
automationbroker        1d
cluster-logging         1d
descheduler             1d
etcd                    1d
federationv2            1d
jaeger                  1d
metering                1d
prometheus              1d
svcat                   1d
templateservicebroker   1d
amq-streams             1d
packageserver           1d
couchbase-enterprise    1d
dynatrace-monitoring    1d
mongodb-enterprise      1d
```

## Subscriptions

Users consume applications in their namespaces by creating `Subscription`
resources.  Each subscription subscribes to channels so operators automatically
update when new versions are released.

### Federation-v2

The [Federation-v2
Operator](https://github.com/openshift/federation-v2-operator) manages the
deployment of the Kubernetes
[Federation-v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/federation-v2) project.

```sh
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derekwaynecarr/openshift-the-easy-way/master/assets/subscription-federation-v2.yaml
```

The federation v2 function provides a cluster registry via a `Cluster` resource.

To register a cluster in the `Cluster` registry, you can do the following:

```sh
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derekwaynecarr/openshift-the-easy-way/master/assets/federation-v2-registry.yaml
```

### Etcd

The [Etcd Operator](https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator) manages the deployment
of `etcd` on Kubernetes clusters.  Once deployed on the cluster, it enables users
to create new resources using the `EtcdCluster` custom resource definition, and then
take backups via the `EtcdBackup` or perform restores via the `EtcdRestore` resources.

To deploy the etcd operator, execute the following:

```sh
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derekwaynecarr/openshift-the-easy-way/master/assets/subscription-etcd.yaml
```

To create a etcd cluster using the operator, execute the following:

```sh
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derekwaynecarr/openshift-the-easy-way/master/assets/etcd-cluster.yaml
```

To view etcd running in the project, execute the following:

```sh
oc describe etcdcluster -n my-operators
